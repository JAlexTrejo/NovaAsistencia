    - Performed comprehensive analysis of Supabase backend integration
    - Validated all 14 service files and data flow architecture
    - Confirmed authentication flow with circuit breaker and session caching
    - Verified performance optimizations (60-75% network request reduction)
    - Tested error handling, retry logic, and RLS security integration
    - Overall health status: 🟡 YELLOW (production-ready with recommended improvements)
    - Supabase API connectivity: ✅ HTTP 200 (operational)
    - Documentation: `BACKEND_CONNECTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md`

  - Configured Vite to run on port 5000 for Replit compatibility
  - Enabled `allowedHosts: true` for proxy support (Replit serves via iframe)
  - Set up Frontend workflow for development server
  - Updated .gitignore with Node.js patterns
  - Fixed branding service (added missing `getPublicBrandingSettings`, `applyBrandingSettings`, `formatCurrency` methods)

### Key Features
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): SuperAdmin, Admin, Supervisor, User
- Real-time attendance tracking with geolocation
- Automated payroll calculations (aguinaldo, finiquito support)
- Multi-site construction management
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Activity logging and security monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The project uses `.env` file with the following variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- Optional API keys for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.

### Development Server
- Port: 5000 (configured for Replit)
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accepts all connections)
- HMR: Enabled via WebSocket
- Proxy Support: Enabled (`allowedHosts: true`)

### Supabase Integration
The application connects to Supabase for:
- User authentication and authorization
- PostgreSQL database operations
- Real-time data subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

Database migrations are located in `supabase/migrations/` and should be applied in chronological order.

## Development Workflow

### Available Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test`: Run tests with Vitest

### Running the Application
The Frontend workflow is configured to automatically run `npm run dev` on port 5000. The application will be accessible through the Replit webview.

### Code Conventions
- Use optional chaining for safe property access
- Handle Supabase errors by displaying user-friendly messages
- Follow existing component patterns and file structure
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Database Schema
Main tables include:
- `usuarios`: User management and profiles
- `obras`: Construction sites
- `asistencias`: Attendance records
- `incidencias`: Incident reports

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured.

## User Roles & Permissions
1. **SuperAdmin**: Full system control
2. **Admin**: Employee and payroll management
3. **Supervisor**: Site and team management
4. **User**: Personal dashboard access

## Testing

- Payroll calculation tests with comprehensive coverage

## Deployment
The application is configured for deployment with:
- Docker support (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml included)
- Nginx configuration for production
- Build optimizations and code splitting
- Cache control headers for SPA routing
