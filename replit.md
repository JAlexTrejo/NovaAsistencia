    - Overall health status: ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW (production-ready with recommended improvements)
    - Supabase API connectivity: âœ… HTTP 200 (operational)
    - Documentation: `BACKEND_CONNECTIVITY_ANALYSIS.md`
  
  - **Professional Footer Component**:
    - Created global footer with Nova Axis Consulting branding
    - Integrated across all pages via Routes.jsx
    - Includes company logo and external link (opens in new tab)
    - Sticky footer behavior with flexbox layout

    - Added animated decorative elements (blob animations)
    - Professional form styling with improved visual hierarchy
    - All existing login functionality preserved (email/password, OTP, password reset)

- **September 29, 2025**: Replit environment setup and comprehensive testing
  - Configured Vite to run on port 5000 for Replit compatibility
  - Enabled `allowedHosts: true` for proxy support (Replit serves via iframe)
  - Set up Frontend workflow for development server
  - Updated .gitignore with Node.js patterns
  - Fixed branding service (added missing `getPublicBrandingSettings`, `applyBrandingSettings`, `formatCurrency` methods)
  - Fixed EmployeeAttendanceDashboard component (was incorrectly exporting service instead of React component)
  - Verified all forms are functional:
    - Employee registration/management with multi-step validation
    - Attendance check-in/out with GPS geolocation
    - Payroll calculation and management
    - Sites/obras creation and configuration
    - Incident registration and approval workflow
  - All navigation, buttons, and forms tested and working correctly

### Key Features
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): SuperAdmin, Admin, Supervisor, User
- Real-time attendance tracking with geolocation
- Automated payroll calculations (aguinaldo, finiquito support)
- Multi-site construction management
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Activity logging and security monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The project uses `.env` file with the following variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- Optional API keys for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.

### Development Server
- Port: 5000 (configured for Replit)
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accepts all connections)
- HMR: Enabled via WebSocket
- Proxy Support: Enabled (`allowedHosts: true`)

### Supabase Integration
The application connects to Supabase for:
- User authentication and authorization
- PostgreSQL database operations
- Real-time data subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

Database migrations are located in `supabase/migrations/` and should be applied in chronological order.

## Development Workflow

### Available Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test`: Run tests with Vitest

### Running the Application
The Frontend workflow is configured to automatically run `npm run dev` on port 5000. The application will be accessible through the Replit webview.

### Code Conventions
- Use optional chaining for safe property access
- Handle Supabase errors by displaying user-friendly messages
- Follow existing component patterns and file structure
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Database Schema
Main tables include:
- `usuarios`: User management and profiles
- `obras`: Construction sites
- `asistencias`: Attendance records
- `incidencias`: Incident reports
- `logs_actividad`: Activity audit logs

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured.

## User Roles & Permissions
1. **SuperAdmin**: Full system control
2. **Admin**: Employee and payroll management
3. **Supervisor**: Site and team management
4. **User**: Personal dashboard access

## Testing
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Payroll calculation tests with comprehensive coverage

## Deployment
The application is configured for deployment with:
- Docker support (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml included)
- Nginx configuration for production
- Build optimizations and code splitting
- Cache control headers for SPA routing
